### [TagToday](https://github.com/zdong1995/productivity_script/tree/master/OmniFocus/TagToday)
For my weekly plan, I will tag some tasks with tag `this week`. Then to get things done everyday, I will select some tasks to tag `today` and then remove the tag `this week`. This script will help you do this just by one click.
