# Tyme Hooks with OmniFocus
This is an applescript hook for Tyme to automate with OmniFocus. For each task you completed in Tyme, the script will automatically complete the task with same name in OmniFocus, and then update the task name with a pair of time: `real spent time / planned time`.

e.g. `Finish writing documentation` will become `Finish writing documentaton ✅ 3.0/3.5`.

# How to use?

## 1. Download the script file
Download the `tyme3_applescript_hooks.scpt` file and move to the folder `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.tyme-app.Tyme3-macOS/` (if it’s not there, create it).
For Tyme 2, rename the hook file to `tyme2_applescript_hooks.scpt` file and move to the folder `~/Library/Application Scripts/de.lgerckens.Tyme2/`.

## 2. Enjoy!
The hook will be automatically triggered when you complete one task in Tyme.
