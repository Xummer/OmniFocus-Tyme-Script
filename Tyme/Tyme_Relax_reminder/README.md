# Tyme Relax Reminder
This is an applescript hook for Tyme to automate setting a 15min alarm to start playing music in NeteaseMusic, in order to remind you to go back to work.

# How to use?

## 1. Download the script file
Download the `tyme3_applescript_hooks.scpt` file and move to the folder `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.tyme-app.Tyme3-macOS/` (if itâ€™s not there, create it).
