# Tyme Scripts
Scripts related to time management and time log with [Tyme 2](https://tyme-app.com/en/) app.

## How do I use?
### 1. Hooks script
Download the `tyme2_applescript_hooks.scpt` file and move to the folder `~/Library/Application Scripts/de.lgerckens.Tyme2/` (if itâ€™s not there, create it).
For Tyme 3, rename the hook file to `tyme3_applescript_hooks.scpt` file and move to the folder `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.tyme-app.Tyme3-macOS/`.

### 2. Other scripts
For the other scripts, just download the `.scpt` files and move to anywhere you like. Using `Script Editor` to run the script or using third-party script running applications to trigger the script.
