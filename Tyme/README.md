# Tyme Scripts
Scripts related to time management and time log with [Tyme](https://tyme-app.com/en/) app.

## How do I use?
### 1. Hooks script
Download the `tyme3_applescript_hooks.scpt` file and move to the folder `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.tyme-app.Tyme3-macOS/` (if itâ€™s not there, create it).
For Tyme 2, rename the hook file to `tyme2_applescript_hooks.scpt` file and move to the folder `~/Library/Application Scripts/de.lgerckens.Tyme2/`.

### 2. Other scripts
For the other scripts, just download the `.scpt` files and move to anywhere you like. Using `Script Editor` to run the script or using third-party script running applications to trigger the script.

## Script Library

These features can be adjusted based on your workflow. To use one more component, just copy another script code into the `tyme3_applescript_hooks.scpt` or `tyme2_applescript_hooks.scpt` and save your script.
