# Tyme 2 Hooks with OmniFocus
This is an applescript hook for Tyme 2 to automate with OmniFocus. For each task you completed in Tyme, the script will automatically complete the task with same name in OmniFocus, and then update the task name with a pair of time: `real spent time / planned time`.

e.g. `Finish writing documentation` will become `Finish writing documentaton ✅ 3.0/3.5`.

# How to use?

## 1. Download the python file
Download the `tyme2_applescript_hooks.scpt` file and move to the folder `~/Library/Application Scripts/de.lgerckens.Tyme2/` (if it’s not there, create it).
For Tyme 3, rename the hook file to `tyme3_applescript_hooks.scpt` file and move to the folder `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.tyme-app.Tyme3-macOS/`.

## 2. Enjoy!
The hook will be automatically triggered when you complete one task in Tyme 2.
